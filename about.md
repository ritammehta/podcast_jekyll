A2Z is a "popular" improv podcast hosted by two lovable nerds with nothing to lose!

**Eugene Wolfe** is a man of indiscriminate age who works for the mayor's office. He may or may not be with his fianc√©e, Catherine. He lives in Kerrytown and loves it.

**Charlie Watts** is an 18-year old intern who may or may not have been a dog at one point? His perfect day on the beach would involve "eating" and "not taking my shirt off".

Each week, we interview fun and new interesting people from around the town of Ann Arbor, Michigan. Subscribe to hear some wild and wacky stuff!
