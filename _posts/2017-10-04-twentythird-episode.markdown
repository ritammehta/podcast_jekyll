This is the finale. Banksy. Andrea Phillips. Seppuku. Zanzibar. Poachers. The Better Business Bureau. Bean and Gerris. They're all here, baby. Thanks for listening. There are technical difficulties, and we apologize for that.

Thanks to Ryan Cox for being a stellar engineer, and thanks to the Stellars for being an engineer band.
