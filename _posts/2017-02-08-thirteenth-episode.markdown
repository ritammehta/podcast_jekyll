In this episode, Charlie isn't around to co-host. Weirdly enough, he's kinda been missing for a while? Anyway, the guest today is James Jonathan, founder of Jimmy John's sandwiches. Eugene and James talk about the concept of free smells when they're interrupted by a violent guardian. A kind-of-attentive protector. A grey-ish knight. The Shrew.

This episode brought to you by chapstick.

Special thanks to Ryan Cox for not freaking out at all the vigilante action in this episode.
