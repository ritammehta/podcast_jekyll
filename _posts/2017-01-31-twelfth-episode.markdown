On this week's episode, Eugene and Charlie interview Reggie Breckenridge, a perpetually injured man with an important message for the Ann Arbor community. Also, Charlie might have killed someone, and Eugene might have caused a water crisis.

This episode brought to you by Edgar Allen Poe Emporium and some snowboard shop.

Special thanks to Ryan Cox for being like a British man requesting a Rolls Royce: "A Good Engine, 'ere."
