Welcome to the first episode of A2Z: An Improvised Podcast! In this corker of an ep, we meet our intrepid hosts, Eugene and Charlie, learn a little bit about the mayor's office, and find out that the Ann Arbor Ben and Jerry(')s may not be what it seems. Intrigue! Romance! Puns! This first episode has it all.

If you think the audio sounds bad, we promise it gets better in two episodes! Until then, suck it up, you weenies!

Theme Music by the Stellars. Check them out [here][bandcamp].
