On this episode, Charlie and Eugene catch up on the unexpected success of the A.V. Chub, talk about relationships, and interview Herb Breakfast Sr., a former vet and current dad. Also, a brand new ASMR segment of the pod!

Special thanks to Ryan Cox for being a dutiful engineer. True filial piety is present in the engineer / host relationship and matches the Confucian ideal.

This episode brought to you by the Ann Arbor Civic Opera production of Romeo and Juliet / The Tempest.
