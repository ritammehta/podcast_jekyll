In this here pod
Eugene's out of jail
He's got a rockin' bod
and money for bail

Charlie's being stalked
By a smart bovine
At udders he has balked
one time - no, nine

Our guest today is Greek
of the frat persuasion
His eyebrows are on fleek
and his peanuts mixed with raisins

Our engineer talks
His name is ryan
Of talent he has lots
and we're not lyin'

Corrections on this episode: Eugene incorrectly states that "ombudsman" is a literary device when it is, in fact, a type of public official. His hubris will be the death of him.
