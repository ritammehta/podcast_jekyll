Oh, glorious day! Better audio quality is here! A very special thanks to Ryan Cox for being an excellent audio engineer.

On this episode, Eugene and Charlie interview Bixby Williamson, a scion of Ann Arbor's most notable wealthy family. They talk about immortality, doubloons, and squirrels. Plus, Charlie is a dog! Literally!
