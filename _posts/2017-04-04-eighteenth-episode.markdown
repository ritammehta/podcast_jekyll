In this episode, three of Ann Arbor's foremost bad playwrights perform their latest musical along with Eugene and Charlie.

A stunning indictment of modern societal and gender mores, the musical chronicles the lives of various woodland creatures in Somerset County, New Jersey. This is one show you won't want to miss!

Special thanks to Ryan Cox for being a huge pianist!
