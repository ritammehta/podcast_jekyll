In this episode, Eugene and Charlie talk about mugging, unexpected success, and Evolution Burger. Also, they interview Chunce the Flapper, the self-proclaimed Mr. Hollywood and a local grifter without any nose.

This episode brought to you by a flower shop.

Special thanks as always to intrepid engineer Ryan Cox for being like Woody in Toy Story: not being afraid to deal with a little buzz.
