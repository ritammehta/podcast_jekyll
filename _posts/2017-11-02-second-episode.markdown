In this episode, we interview Craig Urbanator, the dude in the Guy Fawkes mask who plays guitar outside. We also chat a little bit about Necto's history, Charlie's demon dog, the Nickels Arcade, and the Freshman 15 (or, hopefully, the Freshman 100). It's funny!

This episode sponsored by Dave's Power Outlets Ypsilanti/Ann Arbor.

Correction: Eugene, in this ep, incorrectly referred to Monet's getaway as "Givenchy," when in fact is it "Giverny."

If you still think the audio is bad, oooh baby, just wait one episode from now, when you'll hear our DULCET tones wash over your ears in a whole new way.
