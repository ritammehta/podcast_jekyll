Eugene is, curiously enough, missing from this episode. Charlie begins by interviewing Karen Woodsman, a local woman who peaked in high school, but is quickly side-tracked by an insane janitor's loud-mouthed commentary. An episode full of twists, turns, and loop-de-loops, this is one you won't want to miss.

This episode brought to you by Germy's Wormies and Shania Twain.

Special thanks to Ryan Cox for putting up with something this dumb this often.
